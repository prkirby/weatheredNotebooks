 INTRODUCTION
---------------
The Parallax Block module enables the user to select none, Same, or
Opposite directions (vertically and/or horizontally) when creating a block.
Selecting Same or Opposite places a data-attribute which is ready by
the attached javascript file, and then targeted for calculations causing
parallax effect based on 'same' or ' opposite' value.



 REQUIREMENTS
---------------
  * Use of this module requires Blocks to be enabled.
  * Use of this module requires jQuery 1.7 or later.



 INSTALLATION
---------------
  * Install as usual
  * See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7


 CONFIGURATION
---------------
  * Immediately after installation, please make sure that your site is using
    jQuery 1.7 or later. To automate this, try using the jQuery Update module.
  * This module requires no configuration in its initial release. Additional
    releases may change this.
  * The user requires permission to administer blocks.



TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
  * If the option when creating new blocks does not appear, make sure the module
    is enabled. Then, check to see if another module is modifying the block
    creation page.
  * If there are no data-attributes being applied to the blocks when a value has
    been saved, please try updating jQuery with jQuery Updater. This module
    requires jQuery 1.7 or later. After that, please submit a bug report.


      FAQ
---------------
  * Will this module work on mobile devices?
  - No, the javascript is actually disabled on devices with mobile browsers.
    The reason for this is that for touchscreen devices, DOM manipulation is
    frozen during the scroll event, resulting in a stuttery effect.

  * Should I use this all over my site?
  - Probably not. Parallax is a very cool effect, but works best when used in
    moderation. That said, using it in a ton of places on the same page could
    cause some performance issues, especially on slower, older computers.

  * How is this different from the parallax module at
    https://drupal.org/project/parallax?
  - The Parallax module was recently published and has already been deprecated
    at the time of this writing. My personal testing has found several errors
    caused by the other module.

    The other module only allows you to create blocks with the explicit purpose
    of having a parallax effect behind hand-made markup. Parallax Block allows
    you to modify ANY block on your site (including blocks generated by Views)
    to have a parallax effect.
